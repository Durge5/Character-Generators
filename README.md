# Character-Generators
I enjoy playing Permadeath/Hardcore, but when the only kind of character you want to play is the Orc Barbarian things can get a little stale.
To keep games from getting stale I have built Character Generators, that will randomly generate the starts of a character, such that you can
keep your own games from getting stale. 

Currently the only Generator available to everyone is the one for the Do Not Go Gentle Modpack: https://github.com/Arkay-1248/Do-Not-Go-Gentle
This generator has a number of options that may get expanded if people decide they like the idea and use it. I only really need a number of options, and don't
want to come up with anything complex right now for New Game + and other options. Some notes about this Random Character Generator:
- Everything works top down, Race is generated first, then class, then stone.
- You can't work backwards currently, checking match race and class with only the class selected will give you a random race.
- Options for pregenerated name, and pregenerated backgrounds are incoming for those RP lovers.
